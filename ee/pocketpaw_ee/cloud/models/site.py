# ee/pocketpaw_ee/cloud/models/site.py — a published Paw Site + its custom
# domains. workspace-scoped. The capture config (origin allowlist, signed key,
# rate limits, event mapping) lives here so the public capture endpoint can
# harden ingest without a second store. SiteDomain tracks the Cloudflare-for-
# SaaS hostname lifecycle the Domains panel polls.
#
# Created 2026-05-30 (feat/paw-sites-backend, RFC 12 Task 3.2): new Site +
# SiteDomain documents. Capture-hardening fields mirror
# ``pocketpaw.sites_capture.SiteFormConfig`` so the public endpoint reads one
# store. Compound (workspace, pocket_id) index serves the per-pocket lookup.
#
# Updated 2026-06-01 (Phase 3 — local fake-deploy): added ``url`` — the deployed
# site's canonical URL. In LOCAL deploy mode (no Cloudflare creds) publish()
# stores the localhost URL the per-site static server serves
# (http://127.0.0.1:<port>/<site_id>/) so the SiteResponse carries a real
# openable address for the cmux smoke. In the real CF path it is left "" in v1
# (the deployed Worker is reached via its custom domain, surfaced through the
# domains list) until a canonical workers.dev URL is wired.
