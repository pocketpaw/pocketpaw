# ee/pocketpaw_ee/sites/dto.py — request/response DTOs for the Sites control
# plane. Distinct request and response shapes per the cloud 4-file rules.
# Created: 2026-05-30 (feat/paw-sites-backend, RFC 12 Task 3.5).
#
# Updated 2026-06-01 (Phase 3 — local fake-deploy): SiteResponse carries ``url``,
# the deployed site's openable address. LOCAL mode returns the localhost URL the
# per-site static server serves so the caller (and the cmux smoke) can open the
# published site directly. Empty in the CF path in v1 (reached via custom
# domain). The frontend Site type mirrors this in Phase 4.
#
# Updated 2026-06-17 (pocketpaw#1345 backend half — by-pocket preview + status):
# added SitePreviewResponse and SiteStatusResponse, the two by-pocket read DTOs
# the #432 frontend already calls (getSitePreviewByPocket / getSiteStatusByPocket
# in core/sites/api.ts). Field names/types mirror the frontend types.ts EXACTLY:
# preview is {pocket_id, engine, content} (content optional — absent when nothing
# drafted; a rippleSpec for engine="ripple", a {path: contents} source map for
# engine="svelte"); status is {pocket_id, status, is_live} plus the optional
# site_id the frontend type also declares. Without these, every Preview-tab fetch
# 404'd and the builder showed "Nothing to preview yet".
